It is mid January and many pockets are weeping. There is no doubt that, to many, the sound of January sums up everything
between hope and desperation. Could January really the problem? Is it that it is the worst of all months?  Many will point out that it is indeed the case.

I beg to digress. Yes, there are mountains of expenses to cover now, after December milked our pockets.
True, some if not many of us are unemployed. True we have little to no capital to jumpstart a busines
(Yet the little is often always enough).

Enough! We're just having a Monday-after-weekend effect - we're just a little ill-prepared. 
We saw Monday coming on Sunday, but we assumed we would be okay.

## You need better ideas to start a business
I argue that January is a good time to lay good foundations for this year and others that will follow.
But we're on the third week of January. Too late? No, there is time. Time to forge new connections, better relationships,
acquire new ideas, activate ideas we have been sitting on for so long. 


Especially if you're young , you should read widely, and I'm not talking of school but about self-education.
Start with what you are already interested in and you will surprise yourself with how much information you could use.


Keep investing in your mind but remember, the cliché 'knowledge is power' doesn't hold true.
Rather 'knowledge is potential power'. So act on what you read, learn what works and what fails then amplify that which works.

## Execution is primary, experience is overrated
Experience is overrated - read so that you may learn from the successes and failures and others. Eventually, 
execution is everything. Is execution your friend or your enemy. If execution is your friend, you probably are 
learning from others. If not, you probably are only learning from your mistakes.

Invest in your mind to be a great entrepreneur, a great salesman or whatever it is that you call yourself as a professional.
Remember, we all sell our time to at different rates. We are all salespeople. It is just that some of us are more aware of
it and are determined to take optimize their minutes for everything they are worth.

## Don't do it like a robot
Reading is no fun if you read for the sake of it. It is important that you begin with things that interest you.
Yeah, it is better to read a few paragraphs that you actually enjoy than pages of boring stuff. 

Remember you are reading to feed your mind with ideas. If you are bored, if it is not fun, don't do it.
A better approach would be to start looking for books, articles magazines that would quench your thirst for
a topic you've always been curious about.  

## Decide for yourself
Talking of late resolutions? I will leave that to you to decide. Personally, I don’t care about the name you assign to it.
The investment you place in your mind and action is timeless in every sense of the word.
