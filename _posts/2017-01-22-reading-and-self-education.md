I have often spoken in a tone that would lead some people to believe that I loathe education.
As I was reflecting on my conversations regarding this subject, it hit me that some people whom I have engaged might
mistake my attitude to their own detriment. I love education, but have an issue with academia.

Most people stop learning after attaining their bachelor, or master degree. In a way doing most people end up this way, whether they land a job or not at this stage. Few, however, can actually
can even realise their dreams by that.

The argument against academia has gradually been gaining ground over the past two decades.
While the strongest critics of this system of learning are those who prioritise self-learning, the
anti argument resonates with everyone at some level.

I would strongly disagree with a complete departure from academia. As long as there is an industrial workforce, formal education remains relevant.

Make no mistake; both systems are not mutually exclusive. Used in tandem, they could prove to be
extremely powerful. While formal education defines the criterion by which knowledge is acquired, self-education leaves individuals to dictate their own standards for learning.

Even so, disregarding self-learning is probably more dangerous than foregoing formal learning. Formal learning result
in a situation where people temporarily memorize information for
retrieval during tests. Millions of students around the world attend school to obtain certification,
 and thus the priority is often on the end result other than the learning process. This way, in most disciplines,
it is easy for students to leave school almost  the same way they came in.

Self Education requires deliberate effort by one who wishes to improve themselves in a particular area
or for the mere gratification of reading. Notice that my use of 'gratification' does not carry a negative connotation.
Rather, it is used to refer to the act where people seek to broaden their perspective by opening themselves to a myriad of 
experiences. High levels of self-discipline are necessary for one to successfully self-educate.

Academia has made many of us <a href = 'https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2007/09/05/dont-confuse-a-degree-with-learning/' class = 'link-follow' target = '_blank'>confuse a college degree for learning</a>. The truth is that such an outlook on learning is far from the truth. Anyone whose thinking is limited to such a narrow perspective inevitably becomes 'a round man in a square hole'.

Compared to academia, self-education tests one's will to strive. As I ponder on the subject, my head keeps rewinding part of 
Trump's inaugural address, 'we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving'. If you think of
that statement from a simplified individual-level, its implications are nothing short of profound. Nations are made up of individuals, and when a nation's
citizens are striving, that nation is headed somewhere. The main problem today is that many people around the world look up to their
governments to 'strive' for them.

For instance, consider these conversations

<div class = 'important'>
  <p>Dave: These days it is hard to get a job with a bachelor's degree.</p>
  <p>Peter: True, one needs other accompanying documents and or a master's.</p>
  <p>Dave: I think the government should lower the retirement age ... old people should give young people an opportunity to work as well.</p>
</div>

<div div class = 'important'>
 <p>Parent: This government should create good jobs for the youth. All my children have at least a bachelors degree and only two
        of them have decent jobs. The other three are stuck in shoddy jobs.</p>
 <p>Family friend: I doubt that will happen, there is too much corruption and indifference among the political class.</p>
</div>
Just to name a few, there a handful of other variants out there. As much as these conversations underline certain societal truths, they
often miss the point, 'a government should create healthy frameworks for it, citizens, to operate in'. The rest is up to the citizens
to figure out.

Self-education enables people to rise above 'dependency mentality'. It enables people to discover ways of tapping into their ideas and have
the tenacity to lift their ventures from the ground.
