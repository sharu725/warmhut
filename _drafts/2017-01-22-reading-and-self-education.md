I have often speak in a tone that would lead some people to believe that I loothe education.
As I was reflecting on my conversations regarding this subject, it hit me that some people I had engaged with might
mistake my attitude to their own detriment.

Most people often stop learning after attaining their bachelor, or master degree. Doing so works 
for most people, especially because that is all they ever need to keep their carreers afloat. Some
people can even realize their dreams by that.

The argument against mass education has slowly been gaining ground over the last few decades.
While the strongest critics of these system of learning are those who prioritize self learning, the
anti argument resonates with everyone at some level.

I would strongly disagree with a complete overhaul of mass education. As long as there is a 
workforce, formal education remains relevant.

Yeah, both systems are rarely mutually exclusive. Rather, coupled together they could be prove to be
extremely useful. While formal education defines the creterion by which knowledge is acquired, self
education leaves individuals to dictate their own standards for learning.

Even so, disregarding self learning is probably more dangerous than foergoing formal learning. Formal learning result in a situation where people are memorizing information for
retrieval during  tests.  Millions of students around the world attend school to obtain certification
and thus the priority is often on the end result other than the learning process. This way, in some 
disciplines, it is easy for students to leave school almost  the same way they came in.

Self Education requires deliberate effort by one who wishes to improve themselves in a particular area
or for the mere gratification of reading. Even then this resolve in this direction is the first step. High levels of
self discipline are necessary for one to successfully self-educate.
